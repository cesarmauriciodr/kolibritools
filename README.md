DESCRIPTION
The Kolibri Tools (TKT) is the complete code repository and resources used to build cosmonautexperience.com, a transmedia support site for the movie The Cosmonaut (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1629747/ ).

The site is built using a number of FOSS-licensed libraries, being Fat Free (https://github.com/bcosca/fatfree ) the main of those. It is designed to be coupled with an ecommerce package for payment control and user registration. At the moment of this release, Prestashop (http://www.prestashop.com/ )is being used, but it should be trivial to modify the software to support any other eCommerce system.

Also, Vimeo Pro is used to host the multimedia material and to control the access to it. Cartodb (http://cartodb.com) is used to map the events. Cartodb is awesome, check it out!

This work was comisioned by the production company, Riot Cinema (http://riotcinema.com/ ), custom developed by Tecnilogica (http://tecnilogica.com/ ) and paid using a transmedia promotion grant from the Ministerio de Cultura (http://www.mcu.es/ayudasSubvenciones/Industrias/IndustriasCulturales2013.html). Since we believe that public funding should always mean society getting something back, we are releasing this code and resources under a GPL license.

The project is no longer under active development, feel free to fork and extend it. If there happens to be an active fork let us know so we can point this README on its direction.

REQUIREMENTS
MySQL, PHP5 and a webserver. The software has only been throughly tested in Ubuntu 12.04LTS + Apache2 + MySQL5.5 + PHP5.3
